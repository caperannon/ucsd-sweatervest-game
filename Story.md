# Introduction #

Premise:

> Protagonist is a student (possibly a CSE major) at a university. While   at the university, we are introduced to the main characters friends, professors, etc. whatever. It is important that we introduce the main
characters best friend, some love interest (see: healer bitch), a good mentor, and a bad mentor. Good and bad mentors translate to anyone older or in a more respectable position who are viewed admirably or not. Examples might be Ord and Burkhard.

> Protagonist somehow travels to an alternate universe. Protagonist is disoriented, arriving in a rural area. Upon wandering around, protagonist encounters a council of old dudes. The old dudes tell him that it is his responsibility to gather the (THREADS OF LEGEND) in order to save the universe and return to his own world, and that he had been brought here by some supernatural force which later becomes relevant. Said supernatural force should somehow be related to tailoring. The old men bestow upon the protagonist their knowledge of combat or whatever. Conveniently there are the same amount of men as there are types of ability to use in combat. i.e. Physical, Black Magic, White, Green, Rainbow Pony Magic, whatever. voila, jack of all trades protagonist. The protagonist is then told he will be transported to the nearest village and that the old men can help him no more.

> Protagonist appears in typical start of rpg farm town. Upon leaving beginning area queue event in which you run into your best friend. They have no idea who you are. As you explore this town you run into other people you recognize, but none of them seem to have any idea who you are.

> Something catastrophic happens or some shit and you save your best friend from something. Wild pokemon appear in tall grass or something, and you have the skills to fend them off. Your bro does too, but he forgot his sword at home or it broke or something. He can be a blacksmith's apprentice or something. While attacked, he loses the thing he was supposed to get for his master blacksmith. You go with him to tell his master what happened, master dudes a dick and disowns him, but since your dude is in debt to you he offers to help you with whatever you're doing.

> You tell him what has happened so far, and that you're supposed to find these threads or some stuff. He says you should visit the church of the loom (brilliant) in the next town over. Dude joins party.

> Traveling to next town and shit, you visit church of whatever. This town has shops and stuff. At the church, you encounter good mentor and the love interest healer bitch. You ask good mentor for advice and he tells you to go to the first dungeon and assigns healer bitch to assist you, because she knows where it is and it is the church's responsibility to help people with stuff like this.

> Healer bitch joins party and you're on your way to the first dungeon.
